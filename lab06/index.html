                    <li>Baby Reindeer is based on a true story.</li>
                    <li>It premiered on Netflix on 11 April 2024.</li>
                    <li>It has 1 season and 7 episodes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Honestly, this show has some scenes that are disturbing, but once you start watching it, you will be glued to it. The actors are amazing, and another reason this show is amazing is because the author talks about his trauma but also he didn’t hide his faults.
