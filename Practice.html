        <h2>I have gotten a lot of practice with coding, HTML, as well as CSS</h2>
        <p>I use the textbook and the course content to study. I also find the tutorials Professor Veronica posts helpful. An outside source I use is W3Schools; it is great to learn more about HTML and CSS and provides great examples.</p>
