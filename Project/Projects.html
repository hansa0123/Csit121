        <h2>So far this semester, we have had 4 labs</h2>
        <p>The first lab was simple; we just had to code our favorite recipe. Mine was udon noodles.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The second lab, we had to incorporate CSS. I added color which was fun and still simple.</li>
            <li>The third lab was a bit difficult; we had to add images, but now I know how to insert images.</li>
            <li>The fourth lab was so difficult for me, you guys. I struggled so much. We had to position elements using CSS. I still need practice on this.</li>
        </ol>
