      <h2>Fragrance Families:</h2>
      <p>There are numerous fragrance families, but the primary ones are Floral, Amber, Woody, and Fresh. These four major groups are further subdivided to encompass a wide range of characteristics within each category. Each major group also includes subfamilies. The modern fragrance wheel, devised by perfume expert Michael Edwards in 1992, assists both perfumers and fragrance enthusiasts by organizing families with similar olfactory traits adjacent to each other.</p>

      <h2>Notes of Fragrances</h2>
      <h3>There are 3 notes for fragrances:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Base Notes</li>
        <li>Middle Notes aka Heart Notes</li>
        <li>Top Notes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In fragrance, there are three main notes: the base note, the middle notes, also known as heart notes, and the top notes. Top notes, being the lightest and most volatile,creates the initial impression of a fragrance. Middle notes, or heart notes, establish the body of the perfume, becoming noticeable once the top notes dissipate and typically enduring for 3-5 hours on the skin. Base notes serve as the foundation of the fragrance composition, providing longevity on the skin.</p>
